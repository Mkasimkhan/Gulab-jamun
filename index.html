    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan;<br> bring to a boil.

            Let gulab dough rest for 5 minutes.<br> Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). <br>Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of dough.
             When it sits at the bottom<br> of the pan for 1 minute before coming to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring<br> carefully, until dark golden brown on all sides, about 2 minutes.

    <p>Try adding ice cream to these hot waffle balls, you'll be addicted!<br>The longer you leave the waffle balls in the syrup the better it is going to be;<br>some people leave the waffle balls overnight.</p>
    <h2 class="x"><i>Editor's Note</i></h2>
    <p>We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based<br>on a retention value of 10% after cooking. Amount will vary depending on cooking time<br>and temperature, ingredient density, and specific type of oil used.</p>
